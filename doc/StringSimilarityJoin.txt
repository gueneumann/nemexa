PASS-JOIN
Partition scheme:

- using edit distance T, partition string into T+1 disjoint segments
- use even partition and decompose strings into segments
- for two strings s and r, they need to share at least one segment to be similar 

- PASS-JOIN works as follows:

- for N strings S, sort them according to length and  alphabetically
	- means all strings are known when they are compared

- then loop through the sorted list, for each s do:
	- loop through all inverted indices L_i_l with |s| - TAU <= l <= |s|
	- compute substrings(s) and select among them which gives set W(s,L_i_l)
		- for each w: check whether it is in L_i_l and if so compute candidate pairs <s,r>
		- verify pairs using ed(r,s)

- Possible implementation:
  - incrementally build length-chunk index for first N strings (e.g., N=10000)
  	- alphabetically sort the strings in the l-sets
  - Compute l_min and l_max;

  - call PASS-join on sorted l-sets (could be done as external process -> map reduce approach possible)
  
  - combine results of different candidate sets
  
NOTE: This is already a map-reduce approach, but simulated with time-line
(GOOD - since they propose now MASS-JOIN, I understood their ideas)
  

Inverted index:
  	- partition string s into TAU+1 segments i
  	- use length l(s) as index -> create vector L in increasing order
  		- and then use positions of segments i in s as index -> each L-field l is a vector S_l of segment positions; 
  			this vector has size TAU+1
  		- and then insert all segments i in field S_L_i -> 
  			all segments at position i of strings with length l
  			NOTE: strings are sorted, so also the segments
  		- and then all strings in l are inserted into hash field of correspondence segment
  		
  - for new string s, compute possible substrings which are used as retrieval query into this index
  	- first, compute length of len(s)=s_l
  	- length restriction: then determine left/right length boundaries l for s using TAU
  	- compute all substrings from s given l and match agains inverted index:
  	- shift restrictions: each segment i has a position p_i, so filter out substrings 
  		that overlap between two positions
  		- that is only substrings with start positions [p_i - tau, p_i + tau] and length l_i are considered
  		- that is I compute the start position of substring s by using 
  			the position of the segments in the index MINUS/PLUS TAU
  	- min/max start position:
  		- the idea is to determine a substring and if it matches with some segment, 
  			then determine distance of left and right parts between s and r
  		- when a match is found, then check edit distance of left/right parts (basically check their length difference!) 
  			of strings r and s
  		- if the sum of the distances of left parts ande right parts are larger than TAU, 
  			we can prune the string s, because it cannot be similar to r
  	- min/max is similar to the approach in FAERIE -> binary-shift operation, but also enumerate-candidate-pairs
  
  - verification:
  	- improvement of dynamic algorithm using length-difference and prefix sharing
  	- could be possible to integrate it into Ualign
 
 - PASS-JOIN only needs relative small memory footprint also because it is incremental and 
 	can remove fully visited indices (much better than tries)
 - So, I might try implementing a version of it soon
 	- i can also combine it with clustering methods then
 
MASS-JOIN:

- uniform similarity join
- map reduce framework
